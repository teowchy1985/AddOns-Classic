## Why use Gargul?
- If you use Softres, TMB, DFT or a combination of these then it'll make your life a lot easier
- If you run GDKPs you can auction items one by one or in batches
- Gargul tracks player rolls for you and speeds up assigning loot drastically
- It picks up loot automatically and can send it to anyone in the raid
- It shows how long items in your inventory can still be traded
- Set up automatic rolling for group loot

## Main Slash Commands
- `/gl` - shows the GUI
- **GDKP**: `/gdkp`. Use `/gl ma` to auction multiple items at once
- **Softres**: `/gl sr` or **Classicpr.io**: `/gl prio3`
- **TMB**: `/gl tmb` or **DFT**: `/gl dft`
- To auto loot everything and speed up raids and farming? `/gl pm`
  
  
- Want to know what else it can do? `/gl help`

## Does everyone in the raid need Gargul?
No! For most of the features only the loot master needs Gargul.

## Default Hotkeys
- ALT_CLICK an item to roll it out or auction it off
- ALT_SHIFT_CLICK an item to award it to someone
- CTRL_SHIFT_CLICK an item to mark it for disenchant
